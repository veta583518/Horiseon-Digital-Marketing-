# Horiseon-Digital-Marketing-

## Purpose

This challenge will allow me to get more familiar with aspects of web development, accessibilty and SEO. Starter code has been provided to be refactored.

### Some noted changes that were made 

* Consolidated the styling of elements in the benefits section.

* Updated many of the tags from divs to more specific names, such as <nav>, <article>, <section>, <header>, & <footer>.

* Gave the file a more descriptive title.

* Added <alt> tags to <img>.

* Corrected <a> so that all links are functionable.
