# Horiseon-Digital-Marketing-

## Purpose

This challenge will allow me to get more familiar with aspects of web development, accessibilty and SEO. Starter code has been provided to be refactored.

### Some noted changes that were made 

* Consolidated the styling of elements in the benefits section.

* Updated many of the tags from divs to more specific names, such as nav, article, section, header, and footer.

* Gave the file a more descriptive title.

* Added alt tags to images.

* Corrected all links so that they are functionable.


Below is a screenshot of the mock-up that was to be followed
